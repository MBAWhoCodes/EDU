# URL Hacking

When attempting to create a custom button in Salesforce, you will need to understand some of the following URL syntax:

```
/_ui/core/email/author/EmailAuthor?  (launches the email page)
p3_lkid=  (field ID)
p2_lkid=  (the "To" field where you will populate the ID record with an email address)
&retURL=%2F (return URL)
```
